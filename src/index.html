            <p>
                Greetings! I'm James Robley Joachim, a 33-year-old programmer analyst with a deep passion for coding and design. 
                My expertise spans across HTML, CSS, C#, WPF, and SQL, and my journey in this field began with a strong foundation 
                in academic excellence at CDI College. I thrive on the delicate interplay between design and functionality, 
                channeling my enthusiasm into crafting seamless and visually appealing websites, logos, and diverse applications. </br></br> 
                My proficiency in HTML and CSS ensures that each website I work on is not just functional but also a visual masterpiece, 
                blending aesthetics with user-friendly design. When it comes to developing robust applications, I prefer to wield C# 
                and WPF as my tools of choice.</br></br> I see myself not just as a programmer but as an artist in 
                the digital landscape, painting with lines of code and colors of creativity. In the realm of databases, SQL is where I excel.
                My ability to structure and manipulate data adds a layer of intelligence to the systems I create, ensuring they are not only 
                visually appealing but also functionally robust. In essence, I am not just a programmer analyst; I consider myself a digital
                architect shaping the online world with my passion and skill. </br></br> Whether I'm building captivating websites or developing seamlessly
                performing applications, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and artistic flair to every project I undertake.
                My journey from CDI College to the forefront of programming is a testament to my dedication, and my creations speak louder 
                than words in conveying the love I have for what I do.
            </p>

            <h1>What is Programmer-analyst - LEA.9C?</h1>
            <p>
                CDI College’s Programmer Analyst - LEA.9C program is designed for students who wish to pursue a
                career in the development and updating of software applications. Programmer analysts develop
                applications in multiple environments such as Web and databases, by mastering both the techniques
                related to structured programming and those related to object-oriented programming. They can work
                in companies that have their own IT department, that produce software or that provide various
                IT services. </br></br> Tasks can relate to analysis and design, construction and testing as well as
                implementation and integration into the targeted IT environment. </br></br> Programmer analysts can also
                improve existing software and act as resource people for a network of users. The program focuses
                on Microsoft Visual C #, .NET, UML, Microsoft Project ™, Microsoft Access ™, Microsoft Office ™,
                Microsoft Visio ™, Javascript, MySQL, SQL Server, HTML, CSS and PHP. </br></br> Additionally, students
                will
                learn the Java programming language, and get an introduction to CMS, AW, Agiles and programming for
                Android mobile devices.
